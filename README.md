# Nexa System Language

> A modern system programming language designed for Linux kernel-level and OS development.

---

## Introduction

**Nexa** is a lightweight, high-performance programming language inspired by Go, C++, and Python, built specifically for Linux system development.  
It provides the simplicity of Go, the power of C++, and the readability of Python — all combined into one tool for building operating systems, kernels, drivers, and low-level applications.

## Key Features

- ⚙️ Designed for system-level programming
- 🛠️ Built with Go and modern compiler techniques
- 🐧 Native support for Linux APIs and kernel modules
- 🔥 Simple syntax, powerful constructs
- 🚀 Focused on speed, safety, and control

## Why Nexa?

Traditional system languages often trade readability for power.  
Nexa aims to bridge this gap, offering a modern developer experience while staying close to the metal.

- Minimalistic but expressive syntax
- Direct memory and device access
- Safe concurrency models
- Module and package system designed for OS-level projects

## Example (Hello World)

```nexa
fn main() {
    print("Hello, Nexa World!");
}
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [ ] Basic Compiler
- [ ] Standard Library
- [ ] Kernel Module Examples
- [ ] Full OS Examples
